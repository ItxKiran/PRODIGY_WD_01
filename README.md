# Interactive Navigation Menu

## Overview

This project showcases the creation of an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu offers fixed positioning, dynamic color changes on scroll, and hover effects for enhanced user interaction and visual appeal.

## Features

- **Fixed Positioning:** The navigation menu stays fixed at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down the page, ensuring easy access to navigation links at all times.

- **Dynamic Color Changes:** The background color of the navigation menu adjusts based on the user's scroll position, providing visual feedback and improving usability.

- **Hover Effects:** Menu items change their appearance (such as color or background color) when hovered over, enhancing interactivity and guiding user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Utilized to structure the navigation menu using semantic elements (`<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`), ensuring accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

- **CSS:** Styled the navigation menu for layout, typography, and responsive design. Techniques like `position: fixed;`, transitions, and hover effects were implemented to enhance visual appeal and usability.

- **JavaScript:** Implemented to add interactivity by detecting scroll events for dynamic color changes and handling hover effects on menu items, thereby improving user experience.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ItxKiran/navigation-menu.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a Browser:**
   This will display the navigation menu in action, allowing you to observe its behavior with scrolling and hovering.

## Usage

- **Customization:** Modify the HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`styles.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`) files to tailor the navigation menu to your specific design preferences:
  - Adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects in `styles.css`.
  - Update menu items or add new sections in `index.html`.
  - Enhance interactivity or add new features in `script.js`.

- **Integration:** Easily integrate the navigation menu into your projects by adapting the provided code. Ensure compatibility with existing styles and functionalities for seamless integration.
